                <h1>About Jacob</h1>
                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                  Hey. I'm Jacob. If I had to sum up my personality and
                  motivations in a short description, I would tell you this: I
                  am a problem solver. I graduated in 2016 with a degree in
                  Mechanical Engineering with the goal of becoming a designer.
                  With a few years of automation systems design under my belt, I
                  moved back into the familiar territory of R&D, this time in
                  the world of Aerospace.

                  <br /><br />
                  I had originally went into Mech. Eng. because I thought it
                  would put me into a position to solve the problems at the
                  cutting edge of what humanity is capable of. Only, as the
                  years went by and I learned more, I realized time and time
                  again that the cutting edge requires computation at
                  increasingly more demanding scales. I began to realize that I
                  needed a new set of skills in order to get myself into the
                  position I had wanted to be in years prior. So I followed the
                  technology and put my previous experiences and design
                  capabilities to work to pursue software engineeering and
                  explore solutions to big problems.
                  <br /><br />
                  As the pandemic hit and layoffs happened, I took the
                  opportunity to build something. I hadn't programmed anything
                  serious in several years, but nevertheless, I pushed through
                  the sea of things I didn't know and prototyped a real estate
                  app in excel, written in visual basic. My love for programming
                  was rekindled, and after deciding that I wasn't skilled enough
                  to build the real estate app the way that it needed to be done
                  - as a web app- I began to teach myself web development full
                  time.

                  Even though my focus is software now, I find quite a lot of
                  value in the overlap of Mechanical Design and Software Design.
                  I list some of my accomplishments here in light of this, and I
                  hope you see the value in them also.

              tried and true - stuff I have the bulk of my experience in. If its
              on the list, I have used it in production, not just tooled around

                        <h3>Hyperion Web</h3>
                        <p>
                          Hyperion Web is my brainchild. My long term goal is to
                          turn it into a tech incubator that licenses creative
                          software tools. In the short term, its a marketing
                          company with a focus on getting extremely well
                          performing sites into the hands of small business
                          owners. Serving these clients has informed a lot of my
                          trajectory for what value-add tooling may look like.

                        <h3>Collider</h3>
                        <p>
                          Collider is a big experiment in elementary component
                          design. I have some ambitions for a full-fledged
                          modular library that is built on the premise that
                          complex apps and sites are built of chains of smaller
                          sub-components, sort of like chains of molecules. My
                          experience revisiting common sets of UI components for
                          each site time after time has me interested in
                          developing this for use at Hyperion, serving clients.

                        <p>
                          Quantum Thought is a blog I dreamt up as a platform
                          for me to think and write about creativity. I have a
                          lot of experience synthesizing ideas and designs and
                          so its really fun to dive a bit deeper into how the
                          human brain works to achieve such creative synthesis.
                          There is a lot of overlap with the field of
                          computational creativity, which I am quite taken by.

                <li>
                  Reading & Learning. I take great pride in my curated digital
                  library of best books on a given topic. I have to remind
                  myself that if I read all the time, I never get the doing
                  done. Its my go-to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Physics. I like to think long and hard about the underlying
                  mechanics of things. Lots of Open Courseware lectures!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Kite Flying. Not that kind of kite. Power kites are like the
                  kind that you would use kite-boarding in the ocean. I do it on
                  land on a mountain board. Its a good time.
                </li>

                  Real Estate Investing. I have an old house I am renovating.
                  The plan is to buy 'em and hold 'em.

                  My Wife and Dog are the greatest little family a guy could ask
